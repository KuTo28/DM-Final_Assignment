- Why have you converted some variables to factors? Why not make them binary?

- They have created some variables using a combination of others.

## Questions:

- How do mental and physical illness affect the probability of having a heart attack? Comparte how each type acts as a predictor

## Questions made by teachers:

- For the numerical values why did you use the mean to get rid of the NA's. (Median better if there are a lot of outliers)
